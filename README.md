# letsGetSocial

## Description

All of the back end programming and routing for a social media site. It is set up so that you can create, update, and delete users, thoughts, friends, and comments. You can also use Insomnia to find any particular instance by its ID and remove or view it if necessary. You basically become the overseer for a social community page and can make sure that any content is removed if necessary and that everything is running smoothly.

## What did I learn on this project?

I learned a great deal about routes and controllers working on this project. I had first hand experience at how frustrating it can be to have something not work correctly due to issues outside my control, like a program updating to a new version that won't allow certain coding. At the same time though I learned how rewarding it is to find the workaround and get your code running again.
